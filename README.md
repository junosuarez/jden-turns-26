## contributions

yeah sure go for it i could always use more suggestions and i am not the best at planning

## terms and license and code of conduct

code of conduct is if you are being a terrible person i will just ask you to leave, and if anyone else tells me you are being a terrible person or doing bad things to them then i will also ask you to leave. and terms for this repo are that it is just some text i wrote on the internet so do whatever you want with it.
